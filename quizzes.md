1. Question Two: Which of the following best explains the ability to solve problems algorithmically?
* Correct Answer is D. Correct. An undecidable problem is one for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer. Some instances of an undecidable problem may have an algorithmic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem.
2. Question Thirteen: Which of the following code segments correctly sets the value of the variable cost to the cost, in dollars, of using numUnits units of electricity?
* Correct Answer is C. Correct. If the number of units of electricity used is 25 or less, the cost is 5 times the number of units. Otherwise, the cost is 5 times the first 25 units plus 7 times the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. 
3. Question Twenty-One: Which of the following best explains how devices and information can be susceptible to unauthorized access if weak passwords are used?
* Correct Answer is D. Correct. A strong password is something that is easy for a user to remember but would be difficult for someone else to guess based on knowledge of that user. Weak passwords can often be guessed based on publicly available information about a user. Other weak passwords (such as "password" or "1234") can often be guessed because they are commonly used.
4. Question Twenty-Eight: Which of the following best describes the growth in the number of registered users for the first eight years of the application’s existence?
* Correct Answer is C. Correct. From years 1 to 5, the number of registered users roughly doubled each year. From years 5 to 8, the number of registered users increased by about 100 million each year.
5. Question Thirty: Which of the following best explains the relationship between the Internet and the World Wide Web?
* Correct Answer is D. Correct. The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses protocols to connect devices worldwide. The World Wide Web is an information system (of pages, programs, and files) that is accessible over the Internet.
6. Question Fifty: What are the values of first and second as a result of executing the code segment?
* Correct Answer is A. Correct. The variable first is initially assigned the value 100 and the variable second is initially assigned the value 200. Next, temp is assigned the value of first, which is 100. Next, second is assigned the value of temp, which is 100. Last, first is assigned the value of second, which is 100. After execution, both first and second have the value 100.

1. Question Ten: Which of the following could replace MISSING EXPRESSION  in line 2 so that the code segment works as intended?
* Correct Answer is C. This option is correct. The loop should iterate once for each multiple of 5 from start to end. The number of multiples of 5 from start to end is given by Open parenthesis, open parenthesis, end minus start, close parenthesis, divided by 5, close parenthesis, plus 1. For the example given, Open parenthesis, open parenthesis, end minus start, close parenthesis, divided by 5, close parenthesis, plus 1evaluates to 4.
2. Question Twelve: Which of the following code segments will move the robot to the gray square?
* Correct Answer is B. This option is correct. This code segment moves the robot forward two squares, rotates it right three times so that the robot faces the top of the grid, and then moves the robot forward three squares to the gray square.
3. Question Fifteen: Which of the following best compares the values displayed by programs A and B?
* Correct Answer is C. This option is correct. The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the
corresponding value from program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.
4. Question Nineteen: Which of the following code segments best simulates the behavior of the game?
* Correct Answer is D. Correct. In this code segment, three coin flips are simulated, where one result is represented by 1 and the other result is represented by 0. The player wins when the sum of these is 0 or 3, indicating all heads or all tails.
5. Question Forty-three: Which of the following statements about the Internet is true?
* Correct Answer is B. Correct. The Internet was designed to be scalable, using open protocols to easily connect additional computing devices to the network.
6. Question Forty-four: Which of the following is an example of an attack using a rogue access point?
* Correct Answer is A. Correct. A rogue access point is a wireless access point that gives unauthorized access to secure networks. Data sent over public networks can be intercepted, analyzed, and modified. One way that this can happen is through a rogue access point.
